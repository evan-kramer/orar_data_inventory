# ORAR Data Inventory

## Overview
This repository will help ORAR improve accuracy, quality, and timeliness by inventorying the files, tables, and code we use to drive our work. 

Specifically, this repository intends to:
- Document all scripts ORAR uses on the X:/ drive 
- When they were last updated/opened
- Which tables/files they use as inputs
- Which tables/files they create as outputs
